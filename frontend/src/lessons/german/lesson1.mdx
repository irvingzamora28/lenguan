Welcome to your first step in learning German! Today, we'll explore the German alphabet and pronunciation rules. German uses the same 26 letters as the English alphabet, but it also has four special characters: Ä, Ö, Ü, and ß. Let's dive in!

|30 | ß      | [ss]          | This is called an 'eszett' or 'scharfes S', which means "sharp S". It sounds like 's' in "see". |



## Section 2: Special Characters: Ä, Ö, Ü, and ß

These are unique characters in German that you will encounter. Here's how to pronounce them:

|   | Letter | Pronunciation | Example |
|---|--------|---------------|---------|
|1 | Ä      | [ae:]         | It's similar to the 'ay' sound in "say". |
|2 | Ö      | [oe:]         | This is a bit tricky for English speakers. Try to make an 'e' sound while rounding your lips. |
|3 | Ü      | [ue:]         | It's like saying 'ee' but with your lips rounded, almost as if you were going to whistle. |
|4 | ß      | [ss]          | This is called an 'eszett' or 'scharfes S', which means "sharp S". It sounds like 's' in "see". |




## Section 3: Letter Combinations

Certain combinations of letters in German create unique sounds. Here are a few examples:

1. 'sch' - sounds like 'sh' in "ship"
2. 'ch' - there are two ways to pronounce this, either like 'k' in "kite" or like 'h' in "huge", depending on the word.
3. 'ei' - sounds like 'eye'
4. 'ie' - sounds like 'ee' in "see"

## Section 4: Pronunciation Rules

Here are some basic rules that will help you sound more natural when speaking German:

1. The ending '-ig' is pronounced like 'ich' in the standard High German. However, in some regions, you might hear it pronounced like '-ik'.
2. German words usually stress the first syllable, unless there's a prefix or it's a foreign word.

## Examples

Now let's put this into practice. Listen to these words and try to pronounce them:

1. Schule (school) <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={/src/assets/courses/german/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/Schule.mp3} miniPlayer=true />
