## Section 2: Special Characters: Ä, Ö, Ü, and ß

These are unique characters in German that you will encounter. Here's how to pronounce them:

|     | Letter | Pronunciation | Example                                                                                         |
| --- | ------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Ä      | [ae:]         | It's similar to the 'ay' sound in "say".                                                        |
| 2   | Ö      | [oe:]         | This is a bit tricky for English speakers. Try to make an 'e' sound while rounding your lips.   |
| 3   | Ü      | [ue:]         | It's like saying 'ee' but with your lips rounded, almost as if you were going to whistle.       |
| 4   | ß      | [ss]          | This is called an 'eszett' or 'scharfes S', which means "sharp S". It sounds like 's' in "see". |

## Section 3: Letter Combinations

Certain combinations of letters in German create unique sounds. Here are a few examples:

1. 'sch' - sounds like 'sh' in "ship"
2. 'ch' - there are two ways to pronounce this, either like 'k' in "kite" or like 'h' in "huge", depending on the word.
3. 'ei' - sounds like 'eye'
4. 'ie' - sounds like 'ee' in "see"

## Section 4: Pronunciation Rules

Here are some basic rules that will help you sound more natural when speaking German:

1. The ending '-ig' is pronounced like 'ich' in the standard High German. However, in some regions, you might hear it pronounced like '-ik'.
2. German words usually stress the first syllable, unless there's a prefix or it's a foreign word.

## Examples

Now let's put this into practice. Listen to these words and try to pronounce them:

1. Schule (school) <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/german/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/Schule.mp3} miniPlayer=true />
2. Küche (kitchen) <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/german/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/Küche.mp3} miniPlayer=true />
3. Fliegen (to fly) <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/german/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/Fliegen.mp3} miniPlayer=true />
4. Löwe (lion) <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/german/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/Löwe.mp3} miniPlayer=true />
5. Straße (street) <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/german/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/Straße.mp3} miniPlayer=true />

## Exercises

1. **Listening and Repeating:** Play the audio clip, listen to the pronunciation of each word and repeat.
2. **Pronunciation Quiz:** Can you identify the correct pronunciation? Choose the right option.
3. **Reading Aloud:** Read the following sentences out loud: "Ich gehe zur Schule. Die Küche ist groß."

## Conclusion
