# Lesson 4: Basic Grammar - Nouns, Articles, and Pronouns in the Nominative Case

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will focus on the cornerstone of German grammar: nouns, articles, and pronouns. Understanding these will help you form basic sentences and get a sense of how the language works. We'll look at the nominative case, which is used for the subject of a sentence.

## Section 1: Definite and Indefinite Articles

### Definite Articles

| Gender    | Article | Example              |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| Masculine | der     | Der Mann (The man)   |
| Feminine  | die     | Die Frau (The woman) |
| Neuter    | das     | Das Kind (The child) |

### Indefinite Articles

| Gender           | Article | Example               |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------------- |
| Masculine/Neuter | ein     | Ein Buch (A book)     |
| Feminine         | eine    | Eine Blume (A flower) |

## Section 2: Nouns in the Nominative Case

In German, nouns are always capitalized. The nominative case is used for the subject of the sentence, the doer of the action.

| English   | German        | Pronunciation    |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| The boy   | Der Junge     | [deːɐ̯ ˈjʊŋə]     |
| A girl    | Ein Mädchen   | [ain ˈmɛːtçən]   |
| The apple | Der Apfel     | [deːɐ̯ ˈapfəl]    |
| A teacher | Eine Lehrerin | [ainə ˈleːʁəʁɪn] |

## Section 3: Pronouns in the Nominative Case

Pronouns replace nouns and are used to avoid repetition. Here are all the nominative case pronouns in German:

| English                        | German | Pronunciation |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ------------- |
| I                              | ich    | [ɪç]          |
| You (singular informal)        | du     | [duː]         |
| He                             | er     | [eːɐ̯]         |
| She                            | sie    | [ziː]         |
| It                             | es     | [ɛs]          |
| We                             | wir    | [viːɐ̯]        |
| You (plural informal)          | ihr    | [iːɐ̯]         |
| You (formal singular & plural) | Sie    | [ziː]         |
| They                           | sie    | [ziː]         |

Pronouns in German can be a bit tricky due to their case-sensitive nature. Remembering the correct form depending on the case can significantly improve your sentence structure.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<TipBox>
-   **Neuter Pronoun**: The pronoun "es" in German refers to neuter nouns.
<br><br> It's also used in impersonal expressions where the subject is not specified, similar to the English "it" in phrases like
<br><br>"It's raining" (`Es regnet`) or "It is five o'clock" (`Es ist fünf Uhr`).
-   **Capitalization in Formal Address**: In formal writing or speaking, always capitalize "Sie" when addressing someone in the formal "you" form. This shows respect and helps differentiate it from "sie," which means "she" or "they".
</TipBox>

Make sure to practice the pronunciation and usage of these pronouns to become comfortable with their applications in different contexts.

## Practice Exercise

Create sentences using the nominative pronouns listed. Pay special attention to the pronouns "sie" and "Sie," practicing using them in both singular and plural contexts. Share your sentences on the Lenguan forum to receive feedback and engage with other learners!
