	Remember: - Adjectives in Spanish often change for gender and number to agree with the noun they describe. - Use the verb "ser" (to be) to describe permanent characteristics and "estar" (to be) to describe temporary or changeable
	characteristics. - Practice with flashcards or quizzes to consolidate your learning.
