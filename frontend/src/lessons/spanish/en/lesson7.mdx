## Introduction

Verbs are the backbone of the Spanish language, and the present tense is the most commonly used tense in everyday communication. Understanding basic verbs and their conjugation in the present tense is essential for effectively expressing yourself in Spanish.

Let's take a look at some examples:

-   (Yo) hablo español. (I speak Spanish.)
-   (Tú) comes frutas. (You eat fruits.)
-   (Él) vive en Madrid. (He lives in Madrid.)
-   (Ella) trabaja en una oficina. (She works in an office.)
-   (Nosotros) estudiamos mucho. (We study a lot.)
-   (Ellos) aprenden rápido. (They learn quickly.)

As you can see, verbs play a crucial role in forming meaningful sentences in Spanish. Mastering the present tense of basic verbs is a fundamental step in your journey to becoming proficient in the language.

## Section 1: Regular Verbs

| Verb Ending | Example Verb | Conjugation in Present Tense                       |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| -ar         | Hablar       | (Yo) hablo, (Tú) hablas, (Él) habla                |
| -er         | Comer        | (Nosotros) comemos, (Ustedes) comen, (Ellos) comen |
| -ir         | Vivir        | (Yo) vivo, (Nosotros) vivimos, (Ellos) viven       |

<TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/lesson7/audio/conjugation.mp3" />

Here are the conjugation patterns for regular verbs in the present tense:

-   For -ar verbs, such as "hablar" (to speak), conjugate as follows: "hablo, hablas, habla" for "I speak, you speak, he/she speaks."
-   For -er verbs, like "comer" (to eat), conjugate as: "comemos, comen, comen" for "we eat, you eat, they eat."
-   For -ir verbs, for example, "vivir" (to live), conjugate as: "vivo, vivimos, viven" for "I live, we live, they live."

- **Remember**: - Regular verbs follow consistent patterns in conjugation based on their endings.
- Practice using different regular verbs in context to reinforce the conjugation patterns.

## Section 3: Stem-Changing Verbs

| Stem-Changing Verbs in Present Tense |
| ------------------------------------ |

| Stem-changing verbs, also known as boot verbs, exhibit a change in the stem vowel in all forms except the nosotros and ustedes. The most common stem changes occur in e -> ie, o -> ue, and e -> i patterns. Some verbs also follow the pattern of e -> i(e), which involves an additional change in the nosotros and ustedes forms. Let's explore the conjugation of the stem-changing verbs in the present tense through examples:

| Infinitive           | Stem Change | Present Tense Forms                                                                                        | Example Sentences                  |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Empezar (to start)   | e -> ie     | Yo empiezo, tú empiezas, él/ella empieza, nosotros empezamos, ustedes empiezan, ellos/ellas empiezan       | Empiezo a estudiar todos los días. |
| Volver (to return)   | o -> ue     | Yo vuelvo, tú vuelves, él/ella vuelve, nosotros volvemos, ustedes vuelven, ellos/ellas vuelven             | Vuelvo a casa temprano.            |
| Preferir (to prefer) | e -> ie     | Yo prefiero, tú prefieres, él/ella prefiere, nosotros preferimos, ustedes prefieren, ellos/ellas prefieren | Prefiero el café sin azúcar.       |
| Pedir (to ask)       | e -> i(e)   | Yo pido, tú pides, él/ella pide, nosotros pedimos, ustedes piden, ellos/ellas piden                        | Pido una pizza para cenar.         |

- **Remember**: - Stem-changing verbs undergo a change in the stem vowel in all forms except nosotros and ustedes.
- Pay attention to the specific stem-change pattern for each verb.

## Section 4: Reflexive Verbs

Reflexive verbs in Spanish are used when the subject of the verb is also the recipient of the action. These verbs are often accompanied by a reflexive pronoun such as "me," "te," "se," "nos," or "os," which corresponds to the subject of the sentence. In the present tense, reflexive verbs are conjugated to match the subject and are formed with the reflexive pronouns attached to the end of the verb. Let's take a look at an example:

| Pronoun  | Verb      | Example Verb | Conjugated Verb |
| -------- | --------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Yo       | Levantar  | Levantar     | Me levanto      |
| Tú       | Ducharse  | Ducharse     | Te duchas       |
| Él/Ella  | Despertar | Despertar    | Se despierta    |
| Nosotros | Vestirse  | Vestirse     | Nos vestimos    |
| Ustedes  | Sentarse  | Sentarse     | Se sientan      |
| Ellos    | Acostarse | Acostarse    | Se acuestan     |

<TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File="/src/assets/courses/spanish/lesson7/audio/reflexive_verbs.mp3" />

When using reflexive verbs, it's important to remember that the reflexive pronoun should always agree with the subject in both person and number. For instance, "me" is used with "yo," "te" with "tú," "se" with "él/ella," "nos" with "nosotros," and "se" with "ustedes." Remembering these patterns will help in correctly forming reflexive verbs in the present tense.

<Mnemonic content="Remember to match the reflexive pronoun with the subject: Me (yo), Te (tú), Se (él/ella), Nos (nosotros), Se (ustedes)." />

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<TipBox>
- Using reflexive verbs often indicates that the action is being performed on oneself.
- Pay attention to the reflexive pronouns and practice them with various verbs to master their usage.
</TipBox>

Incorporating reflexive verbs into your language skills will greatly expand your ability to express daily routines and self-care activities. Keep practicing and integrating these verbs into your conversations to solidify your understanding of their usage in Spanish.

## Section 5: Using Verbs in Sentences

### Using Verbs in Sentences

To construct sentences with verbs in the present tense in Spanish, follow these guidelines:

1. Identify the subject of the sentence (who is performing the action).
2. Determine the appropriate present tense form of the verb based on the subject.

For regular verbs, simply remove the infinitive ending (-ar, -er, -ir) and add the corresponding present tense ending:

-   For first-person singular (I), add -o (e.g., hablo - I speak).
-   For second-person singular (you), add -es (e.g., comes - you eat).
-   For third-person singular (he/she/it), add -e (e.g., vive - he/she/it lives).
-   For first-person plural (we), add -emos (e.g., hablamos - we speak).
-   For second-person plural (you all), add -en (e.g., comen - you all eat).
-   For third-person plural (they), add -en (e.g., viven - they live).

3. Combine the subject and the conjugated verb to form a complete sentence.

#### Examples

1. Yo hablo español. (I speak Spanish.)
2. Tú estudias mucho. (You study a lot.)
3. Ella vive en Madrid. (She lives in Madrid.)
4. Nosotros trabajamos juntos. (We work together.)
5. Ustedes escriben cartas. (You all write letters.)
6. Ellos corren rápido. (They run fast.)

- **Remember**: - The verb ending changes based on the subject pronoun.
- Regular verbs follow predictable patterns for conjugation.
- Practice using verbs in different sentence constructions to reinforce learning.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we have covered the usage of basic verbs and present tense in Spanish. Here are the key points to remember:

1. Basic verbs such as "hablar" (to speak), "comer" (to eat), and "vivir" (to live) are essential in building your Spanish vocabulary.
2. In the present tense, verbs are conjugated to match the subject, such as "hablo" (I speak), "comes" (you eat), and "vive" (he/she/it lives).
3. Regular verbs follow specific patterns for conjugation based on their endings, such as -ar, -er, and -ir.
4. Irregular verbs, like "ser" (to be) and "ir" (to go), have unique conjugation patterns that must be memorized.
5. It's important to practice conjugating verbs in Spanish to become familiar with the different forms for each subject pronoun.
6. To solidify your understanding, continue practicing with various sentences and scenarios using different verbs and subjects. For example:
    - Yo hablo español. (I speak Spanish.)
    - Tú comes frutas. (You eat fruits.)
    - Él vive en Madrid. (He lives in Madrid.)
    - Nosotros somos estudiantes. (We are students.)
    - Ustedes van al parque. (You all go to the park.)
    - Ellas hablan inglés. (They speak English.)

Remember, consistent practice and application of basic verbs and present tense will enhance your proficiency in Spanish language skills. Keep practicing and incorporating these concepts into your conversations and written exercises. ¡Buena suerte! (Good luck!)
