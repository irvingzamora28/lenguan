## Section 2: Pronunciation Tips

Understanding some basic pronunciation rules will help you speak Spanish better. Here are some important rules:

1. **Vowels**: In Spanish, each vowel has a single clear and distinct sound.
2. **Double Consonants**: Some letters like "ll" and "rr" have unique sounds in Spanish.
3. **Accents**: Accents can change the meaning of the word and how it is pronounced.
4. **The letter 'H'**: It is silent in Spanish, it's not pronounced.
5. **The 'C' and 'G'**: Have different sounds depending on the following letter.
6. **Consonants and Special Characters**: Some consonants like 'ch', 'll', 'rr' have specific sounds. Special characters like 'ñ' also have their own sounds.

## Section 3: Vowels

Spanish vowels are known for their clarity and consistency. Each vowel has a single clear sound.

| Vowel | Sound | Example Word | Example Translation |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| A     | /a/   | agua         | water               |
| E     | /e/   | estrella     | star                |
| I     | /i/   | iglesia      | church              |
| O     | /o/   | ojo          | eye                 |
| U     | /u/   | uva          | grape               |

<TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/vowels.mp3} />

## Section 4: Accents

Accents in Spanish can change the meaning of words and are essential for proper pronunciation.

| Accented Letter | Example Word | Example Translation |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Á               | papá         | dad                 |
| É               | café         | coffee              |
| Í               | sí           | yes                 |
| Ó               | móvil        | mobile              |
| Ú               | menú         | menu                |

<TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/accents.mp3} />

Accents can change both the meaning and the stress of the word.

For instance, "papá" means "dad," while "papa" means "potato."

| Accented Letter | Example Word | Example Translation |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Á               | papá (dad)   | papa (potato)       |
| É               | Él (he)      | el (the)            |
| Í               | sí (yes)     | si (if)             |
| Ó               | Solo (alone) | sólo (only)         |
| Ú               | Tú (you)     | tu (your)           |

In the following audio pay attention to the difference in pronunciation between words with accented and unaccented vowels.

Note that there is not much of a difference if the accent is in a one syllable word or if the accent is in the first syllable.

<TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/accents-comparison.mp3} />

Remember, learning accents is a gradual process, and it's okay to take your time.

You don't have to worry about getting them perfect right away. Focus on understanding their importance and keep practicing. With exposure and repetition, you'll get more comfortable with accents over time.

## Section 6: The Letter 'H'

The letter 'H' is silent in Spanish. It does not have a sound but is important in spelling.

| Letter 'H' | Example Word | Example Translation |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| H          | hola         | hello               |
|            | hacer        | to do               |
|            | huevo        | egg                 |
|            | hielo        | ice                 |
|            | hallar       | to find             |
|            | hambre       | hunger              |
|            | prohibir     | to prohibit         |

Understanding that 'H' doesn't contribute to the word's pronunciation will help you avoid one of the common pitfalls for learners of Spanish.

<TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/letter-h.mp3} />

## Section 7: The 'C' and 'G'

The letters 'C' and 'G' can have different sounds depending on the letter that follows.

The pronunciation of 'C' and 'G' in Spanish depends on the letter that follows them.

Here's how you can identify and apply the correct sound:

'C' will sound like an English 'S' before 'E' or 'I' (like in "cielo")

| Letter | Sound Before 'E' or 'I' | Example Word | Example Translation |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| C      | /θ/ or /s/              | cielo        | sky                 |
|        |                         | ciudad       | city                |
|        |                         | cebolla      | onion               |
|        |                         | cena         | dinner              |

'C' will sound like a 'K' otherwise (like in "casa")

| Letter | Sound otherwise | Example Word | Example Translation |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| C      | /k/             | casa         | house               |
|        |                 | comer        | to eat              |
|        |                 | corto        | short               |
|        |                 | corazón      | heart               |

<TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/letter-c.mp3} />

'G' will sound like a harsh 'H' before 'E' or 'I' (like in "gente")

| Letter | Sound before 'E' or 'I' | Example Word | Example Translation      |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| G      | /x/                     | gente        | people                   |
|        |                         | gemelo       | twin                     |
|        |                         | giros        | turns (as in directions) |
|        |                         | girasol      | sunflower                |

'G' will sound like a standard 'G' otherwise (like in "gato").

| Letter | Sound otherwise | Example Word | Example Translation |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| G      | /g/             | gato         | cat                 |
|        |                 | golpe        | hit/blow            |
|        |                 | grupo        | group               |
|        |                 | guitarra     | guitar              |

<TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/letter-g.mp3} />

## Section 8: Double Consonants and Special Characters

While many consonants are pronounced as in English, some have special sounds, particularly 'ñ', 'll', 'rr', and the combination of 'ch'. Practice these to accurately pronounce words in Spanish.

| Double Consonant | Sound      | Example Word | Example Translation |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| LL               | /ʎ/ or /j/ | lluvia       | rain                |
|                  |            | llamar       | to call             |
|                  |            | llanta       | tire                |
| RR               | /r/        | carro        | car                 |
|                  |            | correo       | mail                |
|                  |            | perro        | dog                 |
|                  |            | jarra        | pitcher             |
| Ñ                | /ɲ/        | español      | Spanish             |
|                  |            | año          | year                |
|                  |            | señor        | mister              |
| CH               | /tʃ/       | chaqueta     | jacket              |
|                  |            | charco       | puddle              |
|                  |            | muchacho     | boy/young man       |
|                  |            | leche        | milk                |

Explanation:

-   **LL** is pronounced like the 'y' in "yes" in most Spanish-speaking regions. However, it may sound closer to the 'j' in "joy" in other regions.
-   **RR** represents a rolled 'r' sound, which is like the tt in "butter" in American English, but stronger. It is distinct and more intense than a single 'r'.
-   **Ñ** is similar to 'ny' in "canyon." It's a sound unique to Spanish and some other languages.
-   **CH** is an exception to the silent 'H'. When 'H' follows 'C', it creates the /tʃ/ sound, as in "church." This is different from most other scenarios where 'H' is silent.

These unique sounds are part of what makes Spanish pronunciation distinct and rich. Practice them to sound more like a native speaker.

<TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/double-consonants-special-characters.mp3} />

## Section 9: Pronunciation Tips

Spanish pronunciation is known for its clarity and consistency. Here are some tips:

1. **Vowels:** Spanish vowels are pronounced shorter and clearer than in English.
2. **Consonants:** Most consonants are pronounced as they are in English, but there are some exceptions like 'j' and 'ñ'.
3. **Stress:** Generally, the stress falls on the penultimate (second-to-last) syllable.

## Section 10: Common Challenges

Some sounds in Spanish might be challenging for English speakers. Here are a few:

1. The rolled 'r': Try to practice this sound by saying 'butter' quickly in American English.
2. The 'ñ' sound: It's like 'ny' in "canyon".

## Examples

Let's practice with some words:

1. Amor (love) <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/Amor.mp3} miniPlayer=true />
2. Familia (family) <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/Familia.mp3} miniPlayer=true />
3. Hermano (brother) <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/Hermano.mp3} miniPlayer=true />
4. Isla (island) <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/Isla.mp3} miniPlayer=true />
5. Jugar (play) <TextToSpeechPlayer mp3File={../assets/courses/spanish/_shared/lessons/lesson1/audio/Jugar.mp3} miniPlayer=true />

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<TipBox>
- **Pronunciation Practice**: Frequent practice improves pronunciation. Try repeating the sounds daily.
- **Listening**: Listening to native speakers is one of the best ways to learn sscorrect pronunciation.
- **Patience**: Pronunciation can be challenging at first, but it becomes easier with practice.
