## Introduction

Accents and punctuation play a crucial role in correctly understanding and writing Spanish. They can completely change the meaning of a word and are essential for proper pronunciation. For instance, "si" (without an accent) means "if," while "sí" (with an accent) means "yes." Similarly, punctuation marks such as question marks (¿) and exclamation points (¡) are unique to Spanish and are used at the beginning and end of a sentence, adding clarity to the meaning. Let's explore some examples to understand their significance:

1. Example of accents:

-   "Cafe" means "coffee," but with an accent, "café" means "coffee shop."

2. Example of punctuation:

-   "¿Cómo estás?" is a question in Spanish, whereas "Cómo estás" is a statement.

3. Accents in differentiating words:

-   "El" means "the," while "él" means "he."

4. Punctuation for emphasis:

-   "¡Cuidado!" means "Be careful!" and the exclamation point adds emphasis.

5. Accents in distinguishing pronouns:

-   "Tu" means "your," and "tú" means "you."

6. Using punctuation for asking questions:

-   "¿Dónde está?" means "Where is it?" and the question mark indicates it's a question.

Accents and punctuation are vital in Spanish, and mastering their usage is crucial for effective communication and writing in the language.

## Section 1: Accent Marks

### Accent Marks in Spanish

In Spanish, accent marks, or "tildes," are used to indicate stress in words, differentiate between homonyms, and follow specific orthographic rules.

#### Orthographic Rules

-   Spanish words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable if the word ends in a vowel, "n" or "s."
    Examples of spanish words that follow this rule:
    "palabra" - stressed on second-to-last syllable (paLAbra)
    "canica" - stressed on second-to-last syllable (caNIca)
    "mesa" - stressed on second-to-last syllable (MEsa)

-   If a word ends in a consonant other than "n" or "s," the stress falls on the last syllable.
    Examples of spanish words that follow this rule:
    "papel" - stressed on last syllable (paPEL)
    "flor" - stressed on last syllable (FLOR)
    "Color" - stressed on last syllable (coLOR)
    "Televisor" - stressed on second-to-last syllable (televiSOR)
    "Taller" - stressed on last syllable (taLLEr)

#### Impact on Pronunciation

Accent marks change the stress and pronunciation of words, helping to differentiate between words with the same spelling but different meanings. For example:

-   "Como" (without accent) means "I eat," while "cómo" (with accent) means "how."
-   "Si" (without accent) means "if," while "sí" (with accent) means "yes."

### Examples

1. Palabras (Words)

-   Hablo (I speak) vs. Habló (He spoke)
-   Tú (You) vs. Tú (You - with stress)

2. Preguntas (Questions)

-   Dónde (Where) vs. Donde (Where - without accent)
-   Cuál (Which) vs. Cual (Which - without accent)

3. Verbs (Verbs)

-   Como (I eat) vs. Cómo (How - with accent)
